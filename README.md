## Study Overview
The scripts in this repository are related to a substudy of the VGO3 project (https://www.rivm.nl/veehouderij-en-gezondheid/onderzoek-veehouderij-en-gezondheid-omwonenden-vgo). This repository contains the code and analysis for a study investigating how livestock exposure affects the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome in adults living in a livestock-dense region of the Netherlands.

## Objective
The goal of the study was to understand whether occupational exposure (goat farming) and environmental exposure (living near farms) to livestock emissions influence the microbial composition of the nasopharynx (NP) and oropharynx (OP), which are important sites for respiratory health and infection resistance.

## Methods
We collected and analyzed:
- Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from:
      Goat farmers (91 NP, 96 OP)
      Rural residents (956 NP, 954 OP)
Microbiome profiling was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 hypervariable region).
Environmental livestock exposure was estimated using farm density metrics and modelled microbial emissions (e.g., from goats, pigs, poultry, cattle).

## Key Findings
Occupational exposure (goat farming) had a strong impact on the respiratory microbiota:
- Increased NP diversity and decreased OP diversity in farmers
- Shifts in key microbial taxa (e.g., higher _Pseudomonas_ in NP; higher _Rothia_ in OP)

Environmental exposure showed subtle but measurable effects, particularly in the NP, though not as pronounced as occupational exposure.
